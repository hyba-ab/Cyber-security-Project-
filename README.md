## Introduction
Our project, the Facial Recognition Based Attendance System, is a solution designed to automate the process of recording attendance using facial recognition technology. By harnessing the power of computer vision and machine learning, our system offers a convenient and efficient alternative to traditional attendance tracking methods.

### Technologies Used:

- **Frontend Tools**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend Tools**: Python, OpenCV (cv2), Flask, NumPy, Scikit-learn (sklearn), Pandas, Joblib

### Development Process:

1. **Design and Planning**: Conceptualized the system, planned functionalities, and designed frontend and backend components.
2. **Backend Development**: Implemented face detection, recognition, attendance recording, and user management functionalities.
3. **Machine Learning Model Training**: Trained the face recognition model using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
4. **Integration and Testing**: Integrated frontend and backend components, performed thorough testing, and implemented error handling mechanisms.
5. **Deployment**: Deployed the Flask application to a server for production use.

## Getting Started : 
#### 1.Prerequisites: 
   Ensure you have Python, OS, OpenCV, Flask, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Joblib installed on your development environment.
#### 2.Set Up Environment:
   Create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies
   ```Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### 3.Install Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries using
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt.
```
#### 4.Data Preparation: Create a directory structure to store user images and attendance records (CSV files).
#### 5.Configuration: Modify any configuration settings in the code as needed.
#### 6.Run the Application: Execute the appropriate script to launch the application.
