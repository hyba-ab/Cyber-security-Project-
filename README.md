# Web-Based Facial Authentication System 
## Introduction
This project explores the development of a web-based facial authentication system, leveraging facial recognition technology to enhance security and streamline user verification processes.
## Project Goals
- Enhanced Security: Integrate facial recognition technology into existing security infrastructure for robust user identification.
- Streamlined User Verification: Provide a convenient and efficient alternative to traditional password-based authentication methods.
- Scalability and Flexibility: Design a system that can adapt to various use cases and security requirements.
## Technical Overview
The system is designed as a web application with two components:
- ### Desktop Application (Optional):
  - Client-server architecture for capturing images, handling user interactions, and processing facial recognition tasks on the server.
  - Python for backend development.
  - OpenCV for face detection and recognition functionalities.
- ### Web Application:
  - Flask web framework for building and serving the web interface.
  - HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for user interface design and responsiveness.
